# Global sea surface temperature fluctuations

## Background on this CLIP

This infographic shows 35 years (1981-2016) of fluctuations in annual sea surface temperature across the globe.  The dataset used reveals a 0.51C increase in temperature over this period, represented by the darkest blue colour tones at the lower end and yellow tone at the upper. A sharp increase in global sea surface temperature is noticeable towards the end of the dataset, hence the yellow 'halo' that can be seen.


## Data Sources

The CLIP uses the following datasets:
- [Level 4 Analysis Climate Data Record, version 2.1](https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/62c0f97b1eac4e0197a674870afe1ee6)
- yearly_global_sst_mean

## Data Preparation

The data for this infographic came from the yearly_global_mean measurements, which provide 35 years of observations.

To prepare the data, follow these steps:
- Open .csv file in an appropriate editor
- Normalise the values to 2 decimal places, for simplicity.

## Creating Visualisations 

To recreate this visualization:
- Using appropriate software, create a 51 step colour ramp (e.g. #00adff to #fafa6e), corresponding with 0.01 degree increments over the 0.51C temperature increase observed in the dataset
- Programatically or manually create 35 vector shapes, representing each year of the dataset, with progressively increased height and/or width (in this example, 10px), to form a mosaic
- Programatically or manually assign to the appropriate colour from the ramp to each progressive shape, according to the temperature value measured for that year
- In the example provided, the middle shape represents the year 1981 and the outer 2016, but feel free to experiment with placement, order and sizing as required.
